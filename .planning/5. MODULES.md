## 1. Risk Register

### What It Does
The firm's enterprise risk register. Maintains every identified risk with inherent and residual
likelihood × impact scores, control effectiveness, direction of travel, and risk appetite.
The 5×5 heat map on the home dashboard visualises the full portfolio in real time.

### Data Written / Created
| Entity | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `Risk` | reference (RR-001), name, category L1/L2, owner, inherent L×I, residual L×I, appetite, direction, inFocus, lastReviewed |
| `RiskSnapshot` | Monthly capture of residual scores — powers the portfolio trend chart |
| `RiskControl` | Inline free-text controls per risk (separate from Controls Library links) |
| `RiskMitigation` | Action-linked mitigation items per risk |
| `RiskControlLink` | Junction: Risk ↔ Controls Library entry |
| `RiskActionLink` | Junction: Risk ↔ Action |

### Bulk Operations
| Direction | Method | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Import** | CSV upload (via Risk Register → Import) | Create/update risks including scores and controls |
| **Export** | Export Centre → Risk Register section | Full CSV of all risks; HTML pack with optional per-risk deep-dive spotlights |

### Feeds Other Modules
- **Actions** — risks link to actions as mitigations (`RiskActionLink`)
- **Controls Library** — risks link to formal controls (`RiskControlLink`)
- **Risk Acceptances** — risks above appetite escalate to formal acceptance workflow
- **Home Dashboard** — 5×5 matrix + portfolio trend chart + stat tiles
- **Export Centre** — included in board-pack exports
- **Audit Log** — every create/update/delete logged immutably

### Why It Exists / FCA Basis
> **SYSC 7 (Risk control)** requires firms to have adequate risk management systems.
> **SYSC 4.1.1R** requires robust governance arrangements with a clear organisational structure.
> **FCA Principle 3** requires firms to take reasonable care to organise and control their affairs responsibly with adequate risk management systems.
> The Risk Register is the firm's primary evidence of compliance with these requirements.

---

## 2. Action Tracking

### What It Does
Centralised log of all remediation and improvement actions across the firm. Actions arise from
risk reviews, control testing failures, Consumer Duty MI, horizon scanning, regulatory changes,
and ad-hoc decisions. Each action has a priority (P1/P2/P3), owner, due date, and status
workflow. Change proposals allow owners to request date extensions or reassignments, with
CCRO approval.

### Data Written / Created
| Entity | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `Action` | reference (ACT-001), title, description, status, priority, assignee, dueDate, source, linked risk/control/CD metric |
| `ActionChange` | Date extension or reassignment proposals — CCRO approve/reject |
| `ChangeRequest` | Formal change proposals linked to actions |

### Bulk Operations
| Direction | Method | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Import** | CSV upload (Actions → Import) | Bulk create actions with priority, owner, due date |
| **Export** | Export Centre → Actions section | Full CSV; HTML pack with optional action spotlights |

### Feeds Other Modules
- **Horizon Scanning** — horizon items spawn tracked actions (`HorizonActionLink`)
- **Consumer Duty** — CD MI triggers linked remediation actions
- **Risk Register** — risks link to actions as mitigations
- **Regulatory Calendar** — regulatory deadlines generate tracked actions
- **Reports** — action pipeline chart and open action counts surface in board packs
- **Home Dashboard** — action tracking section with priority swimlane and stat tiles

### Why It Exists / FCA Basis
> **SYSC 4.1.1R** — Firms must have robust governance arrangements including clear lines of
> responsibility and effective processes for managing risk.
> **FCA Consumer Duty (PRIN 12)** — Firms must identify, monitor, and remediate poor customer
> outcomes. The action register is the evidence trail for remediation.
> **SMCR** — Individual accountability under SMCR requires Senior Managers to demonstrate
> "reasonable steps"; a documented action trail supports that evidence.

---

## 3. Controls Library

### What It Does
Firm-wide library of formal controls across 10 business areas. Each control has a testing
schedule, 12-month test result history, quarterly narrative summaries, monthly owner
attestations, and links to regulations, policies, and processes. A trend graph shows pass-rate
over time. The watched/starred feature lets CCRO highlight priority controls on the dashboard.

> across four outcome areas: Products & Services, Price & Value, Consumer Understanding,
> Consumer Support.
> **FCA PS22/9** — Implementation rules require firms to maintain ongoing monitoring of
> consumer outcomes with documented MI, evidenced RAG assessments, and board-level attestation.
> **Annual board attestation (PROC-020)** — The board must sign off annually that Consumer Duty
> obligations are being met; this module provides the evidence pack.
